# 8-Bit-Beating-Heart-Necklace-PCB
This is the first PCB board that I designed and have iterated upon. This is a wearable board that is controlled by an ATTiny85 which causes the LEDs around the perimeter of the board to pulse in unison, replicating a heartbeat. The board is powered by coin cell batteries and has a switch to be powered on and off.
